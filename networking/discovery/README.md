# Discovery

The discovery and organization of nodes in a peer-to-peer network is often a problem in distributed systems. Early technologies relied on centralized servers, however later technologies such as Tapestry, Chord, CAN and Pastry take advantage of DHTs. One of the most popular protocols utilizing a DHT for discovery is called Kademlia.
